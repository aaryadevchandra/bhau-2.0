# bhau-2.0

bored during exams, short update to bhau.

...


took about 7-8 hours to get this up and running cause my dumb arse can't code

....


if yk js and node, you know how to install the dependencies, if you dont...well you don't.


i still have to host it tho, will do it in a couple days

# WHAT IT DOES


bhau was made a year ago where it would randomly select a roast from a python list, and any new roasts to be added had to be manually added to the list. people usually sent me stuff that I added. 


too much work, so created a frontend where people could add roasts on their on, gets stored in a mongo collection.

still haven't hosted everything, will do it when im free
